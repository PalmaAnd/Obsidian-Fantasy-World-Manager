# Obsidian Fantasy World Manager

Welcome to the Obsidian Fantasy World Manager! This project is designed to help Dungeon Masters (DMs) take notes and keep track of everything they need when hosting a pen-and-paper game. The main feature of this project is the use of templates to organize information about locations, NPCs, items, and more.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `.obsidian/`: Contains Obsidian workspace settings, plugins, and themes.
- `Templates/`: Contains templates for various types of locations and other game elements.
  - `Locations/`: Templates for different types of locations such as cities, dungeons, towns, villages, and wilderness areas.
- `World Name/`: Contains subdirectories for different aspects of your game world, such as bestiary, campaign notes, factions, items and artifacts, locations, miscellaneous, NPCs, session planning, and world lore.

## Using Templates

Templates are a powerful feature in Obsidian that allow you to quickly create new notes with predefined structures. This project includes several templates to help you organize your game world.

### Activating Templates in Obsidian

1. Open Obsidian and go to `Settings` (click the gear icon in the lower left corner).
2. Navigate to the `Core Plugins` section.
3. Enable the `Templates` plugin by toggling the switch next to it.

### Configuring the Templates Plugin

1. After enabling the `Templates` plugin, go to the `Plugin Options` section in the settings.
2. Click on `Templates`.
3. Set the `Template folder location` to `Templates`. This tells Obsidian where to find your templates.

### Using a Template

1. Create a new note in Obsidian.
2. Click on the `Templates` button in the toolbar (it looks like a document with a plus sign).
3. Select the template you want to use from the list. The template content will be inserted into your new note.

## Available Templates
